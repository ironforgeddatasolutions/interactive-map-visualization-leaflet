# Interactive Map Visualization

## Project Overview
This project builds an interactive map visualization to display and explore geographic data dynamically. The goal is to improve understanding of spatial patterns and trends through visual, map-based interaction.

---

## Problem Statement
Geographic data can be difficult to interpret using tables or static charts alone. This project explores how interactive mapping can be used to communicate spatial trends more clearly and allow users to explore data visually.

---

## Data
- Publicly available geographic dataset  
- Data includes location-based attributes suitable for map visualization  
- Dataset required cleaning and formatting prior to visualization  

---

## Tools & Methods
- **JavaScript:** core scripting for interactivity  
- **Leaflet.js:** map rendering and layer control  
- **Data Preparation:** formatting geographic data for mapping  
- **Visualization Design:** interactive layers and user controls  

Key steps included:
- Preparing geographic data for mapping  
- Building interactive map layers  
- Enabling user interaction to explore spatial trends  

---

## Key Findings
- Interactive maps provided clearer insight into geographic patterns  
- Spatial trends were easier to identify compared to static visuals  
- User interaction improved interpretability of location-based data  

---

## Impact / Use Case
This type of visualization can be used to:
- Communicate geographic insights to non-technical stakeholders  
- Support location-based decision-making  
- Enhance reporting through interactive visuals  

Interactive mapping is especially useful in operations, logistics, public planning, and analytics roles where spatial context matters.

## Repository Contents
- JavaScript files for map rendering and interaction  
- Supporting data files (if included)  
- HTML and configuration files for visualization  

---

## Next Steps
- Add additional data layers or filters  
- Improve map styling and performance  
- Integrate with a dashboard or reporting interface  

---

## Resume-Ready Summary
**Interactive Map Visualization** – Developed an interactive map using Leaflet.js to visualize geographic data and support exploration of spatial trends.
